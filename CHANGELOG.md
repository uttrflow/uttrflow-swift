## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-30

### Added
- **Any modifier combination can be the dictation shortcut** — ⌃⌥, ⌘⌥, or a single
  modifier on its own. Only Fn was allowed before, on an argument about ⌘ that had been
  applied to every modifier-only binding.
- **Updates in Settings**: the version, a Check Now button, and a switch for whether an
  update installs itself or asks first. Updating was reachable only from the menu bar.
- **The menu bar says when an update is happening.** Downloading, waiting for a quiet
  moment, and installing each say so. Before this the app replaced itself and relaunched
  in silence, which reads as a crash.
- Continuous integration on every pull request, and a tag-driven release workflow.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `RELEASING.md`, `SECURITY.md` and a code of conduct.
- `Docs/measuring-accuracy.md` — what it would actually take to measure a speech-engine
  change, which turns out to be fifteen minutes rather than the sixteen hours assumed.

### Fixed
- The "install updates automatically" preference is now read at launch. It was hardcoded
  on, so any change to it was forgotten the next time the app started.
- The shortcut field's refusal no longer says "Try a letter, a number or Space" to
  somebody who pressed a perfectly ordinary modifier combination.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-08-29

First public release of the source. The app itself has been shipping since 0.1.0; this is
where its code became readable.

### Added
- Work on this Mac without an Uttrflow account, using the name macOS already knows you by.
  Sign-in was the one screen that could not work offline; it now has a way through that
  needs nothing.
- Automatic updates through Sparkle, checked against a key compiled into each build.
- A Position Monitoring view, and version reporting at the foot of the sidebar.

### Fixed
- The sidebar no longer claims a session nobody has.
- One retention window now governs both copies of a transcript, rather than two that could
  disagree.
